# A Simple, Basic, Handcrafted Kanban Template

A simple, handcrafted Kanban website designed to help you organize tasks and manage workflows efficiently. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project provides a basic yet functional Kanban board template.

## How This Idea Clicked Me?

The inspiration for this project came from the need to have a straightforward tool for task management. While there are many Kanban tools available, I wanted to create a basic version that was easy to set up and use. This project allows you to track your tasks in a visual and intuitive manner, with columns for different stages of your workflow. The current version is a template that clears all data upon refreshing the page, making it perfect for quick and temporary task tracking.

## Features
- **Handcrafted Design**: A clean and functional Kanban board interface built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Interactive Columns**: Drag and drop tasks between columns to reflect different stages of your workflow.
- **Basic Functionality**: The current version is a straightforward template that clears data on refresh.

## How to Get It Personalized for You?

1. **Fork this repository** onto your GitHub profile.
2. **Perform the desired following edits**.
3. **Host it** using any tools you prefer (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.).

## How to Use It?

- **Open the KanbanBoard**: Access the [website](https://KanbanBoard.ship.mridungupta.eu.org) and start managing your tasks temporarily on the go.
- **Add Tasks**: Create tasks and place them in the appropriate columns.
- **Drag and Drop**: Move tasks between columns to update their status.

## Note
- **Data clears on every refresh**: Be aware that all data will be cleared upon refreshing the page.
- **Future Enhancements**: An advanced version with persistent dependance upon user's local storage and additional features will be available soon.
